Installation:
-------------

The zip file has subdirectories in it. You must use the WinZip "Use folder 
names" option to restore this directory tree or you will have problems 
because the files would not be in their proper subdirectories.

This is the subdirectory layout:

.\                            Info directory

If you are reinstalling, or installing a new version, be sure to delete all dcu,
and obj files from vc32 and internet directories. This applies to all Win32 versions.
For Delphi.NET, remove all dcpil files.
Always upgrade your compiler with the latest update available from Borland.
Always updade your system with http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com

DELPHI 2006/WIN32:
Directory VC32 contains IcsDel100.bdsproj which is a package source for
all components. Using Delphi, do a file/open project (Ctrl-F11, browse to the 
VC32 directory. Select IcsDel100.bdsproj and open it. Then in the project
manager view, right-click on IcsDel100.bpl, then click on Install button.
After a few seconds, you should have a dialog box telling you the package 
IcsDel100.bpl has been installed with a bunch of new components registered.
Then do a "Save All" (Shift-Ctrl-S) and a "Close All".
Having installed the package, verify that the VC32 directory has been added to
the Win32 Library Path (Tools / Options / Delphi Options / Library - Win32 / 
Library Path). If not, add it manually.

Once the package is installed, you may open the sample projects. There is a
project group called Del100Sam.bdsgroup which has all sample programs. Open it
with file/open project (Ctrl-F11), browse to the Internet directory, select 
and open Del100Sam.bdsgroup. You will get some dialog box telling you that
resource files are missing (they have not been included in the zip file to 
save space) and are recreated by Delphi. It is OK. Any other error message 
is a problem you should fix. After all resource files have been recreated,
you should see in the project manager a group of projects called Del100Sam.
In this group, you'll find all sample programs.

To compile all samples at once, do Project / Build all projects. This will 
take some time to compile all sample programs. Delphi may run out of
memory if you don't have large RAM installed. If this happend, just build
the project one by one.

DELPHI2006/.NET
Directory Delphi\DotNet contains IcsDotNet.bdsgroup with all projects.
Open it and build all projects.

DELPHI 2005/WIN32: 
Follow Delphi 2006/Win32 installion. Replace "90" by "100" in all project group
or packages.

DELPHI 2005/.NET
Follow Delphi 2006/.NET installation

DELPHI 7: Directory VC32 contains IcsDel70.dpk which is a package source for
all components. Using Delphi, do a file/open, select *.dpk and browse to
the VC32 directory. Select IcsDel70.dpk and open it. Then click on the 
Install button. You should see the FPiette tab on the component gallery.
Add VC32 directory path to your library path (Tools menu / Environment Options
/ Library / Library Path. Add VC32 path at the end of the existing path).

Once the package is installed, you may open the sample projects. There is a
project group called Del70Sam.bpg which has all sample programs. Open it
with file/open, browse to the Internet directory, select and open Del70Sam.bpg.
Then Project/Build all projects. You'll get all sample programs compiled.
It is likely that for each project, Delphi complains about a missing .res
file. This is not a problem, Delphi will recreate it as needed. They have not
been included to save space in the zip file.

Note 1: Delphi may run out of memory if you ask to compile all projects at 
once. If you have not enough RAM, then compile each project individually.

Note 2: Delphi 7 has new warnings which triggers a lot of messages for 100% OK
code. You can turn those warnings off in the project/ options / Compiler messages
and deselecting: "Deprecated symbol", "Platform symbol", "usafe type", "unsafe code", 
"usafe typecast". Those are intended for .NET and Linux portability. You can
safely ignore them if you run windows. For you facility, I included a utility 
SetProjectOptions (source code, you must compile it) in the internet directory.
This utility will update project options to disable the warnings.

DELPHI 6: Same installation as Delphi 7. Files are IcsDel60.dpk and Del60Sam.bpg.
(Note 2 doesn't apply to Delphi 6).

DELPHI 5: Same installation as Delphi 6. Files are IcsDel50.dpk and Del50Sam.bpg.

DELPHI 4: Same installation as Delphi 5. Files are IcsDel40.dpk and Del40Sam.bpg.

DELPHI 3: Same installation as Delphi 5. Files are IcsDel30.dpk. Del30Sam.bpg 
doesn't exist because project group was introduced with Delphi 4. Open each
project individually (*.dpr).

DELPHI 2: Directory VC32 contains all components. You must add all those
components into your library. But warning: not all files are components.
Only those with a Register procedure are components. Other are just support
files and must not be installed as components. To install a component file,
do Component/Install, then click on the Add button, then click on the Browse
button and browse to the VC32 directory. Select a component file such as
wsocket.pas and click on OK. Do it again for all component files and
finally click OK button on the Install Component dialog window. Your 
library will be rebuilt. You should see the tab FPiette added to your
component gallery. If you have an error saying "register procedure doesn't
exists", then you included a file that must not be used to install component.

Once the components are all installed, you may open the sample projects
each one after the other and compile them. For each project, do file/open
and select the dpr file in the internet directory. Then Project/Build All.


DELPHI 1: The install procedure is the same as for Delphi 2. But you must
add the directory VC into the library path _before_ VC32 directory which
will be added automatically when you add the first component source.
VC directory in the library path is needed because Delphi 1 doesn't have 
built in winsock support. ICS contains winsock.pas in VC directory to 
add winsock support. VC directory also contains 16 bits component resource 
files (*.dcr) needed by Delphi 1. VC32 contains the 32 bits resource files.
If you use only Delphi 1, you can safely copy all files from VC to VC32
directory, but not the contrary.

Once the components are all installed, you may open the sample projects
each one after the other and compile them. For each project, do file/open
and select the dpr file in the internet directory. Then Project/Build All.

CBUILDER 2006:
Follow the installation procedure described for Delphi 2006. Just change
the project group and package name: replace "del" by "bcb" in their names.
You can't have Delphi 2006 and CBuilder 2006 packages installed at the 
same time in the IDE. So when switching from one to the other, be sure to
remove the one you don't need.
If you need both BCB and Delphi personnalities ate the same time, then
use Delphi 2006 package (IcsDel100.bpl) and change his options to make it
a dual mode Delphi/CPP package. See Borland documentation.

BCB6: First you need to install all components. There is a package in
Delphi\VC32 directory, called IcsBcb60.bpk. You do File/Open project and
browse to IcsBcb60.bpk. Select and open it, then Project/Build IcsBcb60.
Once the package is compiled, you can install it into your component
palette: Component/Install Packages, click the Add button and select 
Delphi\VC32\IcsBcb60.bpl (you just generated this file by compiling the 
package). Click OK button. You must now see FPiette Tab on the component 
gallery.

Once the components are all installed, you may open the sample projects
each one after the other and compile them. For each project, do file/open
and select the dpr file in the internet directory. Then Project/Build All.
Projects are located in CPP/INTERNET/BCB6. There is also a project group
Bcb60Sam.bpg which contains all sample projects.
It is likely that for each project, Bcb complains about a missing .res
file. This is not a problem, Bcb will recreate it as needed. They have not
been included to save space in the zip file.

BCB5: follow BCB6 instruction below. Package is IcsBcb50.bpk and samples
project group is Bcb50Sam.bpg. Directory is ...\internet\bcb5.

BCB4: follow BCB6 instruction below. Package is IcsBcb40.bpk and samples
project group is Bcb40Sam.bpg. Directory is ...\internet\bcb4.

BCB 3: follow BCB6 instruction below. Package is IcsBcb30.bpk and samples
project group is Bcb30Sam.bpg. Directory is ...\internet\bcb3.

BCB1: First you need to install all components that are located in
Delphi/VC32. Components are all Object Pascal sources. You must select
*.pas when in the open dialog box (Menu/Component/Install/Add/Browse).
Components are files with a register procedure. Do not install files
with no register procedure (if you try, you'll get an error message).

Once the components are all installed, you may open the sample projects
each one after the other and compile them. For each project, do file/open
and select the dpr file in the internet directory. Then Project/Build All.
Projects are located in CPP/INTERNET/BCB1.


NOTES: 
- You may have an error message, using Delphi or BCB, complaining about 
Font.Charset, OldCreateOrder and other properties. Those are new properties 
in newer Delphi or BCB versions. 
You can safely ignore those errors because those properties are not 
used by the components nor sample programs. You may encounter this 
error at run time. To avoid it, you must open each form at design time
and ignore the error. Then recompile. If you don't ignore the error 
at design time, you'll have it at runtime !

- If you have Delphi or BCB complaining about a file not found, add VC32
directory to your library path.

- If you are using BCB3, 4, 5 or 6, you may encounter an error at link time 
such as "Unable to open file MWBCB30.LIB" (or other libs). This is a bug
in BCB. To solve it, close BCB and open the package or project file with 
notepad or any text editor and remove any reference to the missing libraries. 
Then start BCB again, reopen the project and rebuilt it. With BCB5/6 you can
edit project option file (right click in project manager).

- Don't forget that the C++Builder components are located in .\delphi\vc32 
which is object pascal source code (not a problem for C++Builder, just 
indicate that the *.pas files are displayed when installing). C++Builder 
will create the *.hpp files. There are some on-line help files in the VC32
directory.

- Using BCB5 or later, you may have a problem with DsgnIntf.dcu not found.
In their readme.txt file, Borland give this info:
The compiled version of the Design Interface unit, DsgnIntf.dcu, is no 
longer included with C++Builder (or Delphi). To compile design-time 
packages using this unit, you must include the PFLAGS option -LUvcl50 
in the project options for the package's project. From the main IDE 
menu select Project|Edit Option Source to edit the project options. 
In the entry for PFLAGS add the -LUvcl50 option. For example:
<PFLAGS value="-$YD -$W -$O- -v -JPHNE -M -LUvcl50"/>
If you use BCB6, use "60" instead of "50" in the above explanations.
Runtime redistribution of DsgnIntf.dcu was in contradiction of the 
license agreement and so this file is no longer included with C++Builder

- The following is a list of the files that should be installed in order to
properly add all of the available components in this collection:

> WSocket.pas      Winsock component - TCP, UDP, DNS,...
> WSocketS.pas     Winsock component for building servers
> WSocketTS.pas    Winsock component for building multithreaded servers
> WSocketE.pas     Register procedure andproperty editor for TWSocket
> HttpProt.pas     HTTP client protocol - used by the web
> HttpSrv.pas      HTTP server protocol - used to build webservers
> FtpCli.pas       FTP client protocol - file transfert
> FtpSrv.pas       FTP server protocol - file transfert
> Ping.pas         ICMP echo protocol - ping a host
> Pop3Prot.pas     POP3 client protocol - get mail from mail server
> MimeDec.pas      MIME component - decode file attach, use with POP3
> SmtpProt.pas     SMTP client protocol - send mail to server
> NntpCli.pas      NNTP client protocol - send and receive newsgroups messages
> TnCnx.pas        TELNET client protocol - terminal emulation protocol
> TnScript.pas     TELNET client protocol - with automation
> EmulVT.pas       ANSI terminal emulation in a control
> TnEmulVT.pas     TELNET and ANSI terminal emulation combined
> FingCli.pas      FINGER client protocol - Find informations about user
> Wait.pas         A kind of progress bar - now obsolete, forget it for new cod
> DnsQuery         DNS lookup component - useful for getting MX records
> IcsLogger.pas    A component to log informations

As a rule, the components are the files which have a Register procedure.

- The following list support and utilities units:
> IcsDES.pas       Implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES)
> IcsMD4.pas       Implementation of the MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm 
> IcsMD5.pas       Implementation of the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm
> IcsSHA1.pas      Implementation of US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1)
> IcsURL.pas       Support routines for URL handling
> MimeUtil.pas     Support routines for MIME standard
> Icmp.pas         ICMP protocol support, used by the PING component

Note 1: Many samples are similar. When searching for something, always look at the date
        the demos where created. The most recent is always the best code !
Note 2: Not all samples have been rewritten in C++ for BCB. And those rewritten are
        frequently much simpler. So BCB user: have a look at the Delphi sample too !
Note 3: Follow "UserMade" link on ICS website to find more sample programs written by
        ICS users.

As explained in the component installation, you may encounter an error loading
a sample application or running it. This may be because the last time I
loaded the form, I was using another Delphi or BCB version which has new properties. 
You can safely ignore messages related to those new properties. They are not used 
in the samples. (The properties are CharSet, OldCreateOrder and others). 
You can also encounter error about duplicate resources. You can ignore them 
safely. If you have those errors, open each form in the IDE, ignore the error 
then recompile. If you don't open the form in the IDE, you'll get the errors 
at runtime and your program will abort.

If you use C++Builder 1, you may encounter problems because Borland has
two winsock include files: one .h and one .hpp. TWSocket needs the 
winsock.hpp file and it is automatically included. However, sometimes
the winsock.h file is included indirectly and you will get numerous error 
messages from the compiler. Just add a #define _WINSOCKAPI_ before 
your existing #include directives. This will prevent winsock.h from being
included. This is no a bug, it is a feature :-) Another annoying feature
is the SetPortA syndrome. Add a #define _WINSPOOL_ before any #include
directive to work around. If you have some file not found error at
compile time, be sure to verify the project options to change any directory
following your own configuration (include files and library path).
Do NOT use those #include if you use C++Builder 3: Borland has corrected
their mistake.

When installing a new version, always delete old dcu, obj, dcpil and always 
recompile everything ! 
Close everything before recompiling the library or packages.
When installing a new version, be sure to unzip it in the same directory
tree as the old one or you'll mess both versions.

The provided delphi\vc\winsock.pas is for use with Delphi 1 only.
Use Borland's file with all other Delphi versions and C++Builder.

C++Builder 1/3/4/5/6 projects are not compatibles. BCB can provide conversions.
I made separate projects in CPP\INTERNET\BCB1, CPP\INTERNET\BCB3,
CPP\INTERNET\BCB4, CPP\INTERNET\BCB5 and CPP\INTERNET\BCB6 directories. 
If you install this ICS version above a very old one, be sure to delete 
every *.mak and corresponding *.cpp files form the internet directory 
(not all *.cpp files, only those which has a corresponding *.mak file !).

It is possible to use several Delphi or BCB versions at the same time, but 
before switching from one to the other, you MUST delete all DCU, OBJ, ILS, 
ILF, TDS, ILC and ILD files.For BCB, you sometimes need to delete HPP files
as well. They will be recreated when you reinstall ICS components.

your message. I will respond, but anybody is welcome to respond to each 
other's messages. So every body can share his expertise. There are many other
useful mailing lists at http://www.elists.org !

Before asking a question, browse the message archive you can download from
the support page on the website (click the "support" button from main page)
and from the mailing list website http://elists.org/mailman/listinfo/twsocket.
Google is also archiving the list with some delay.

If you found a bug, please make a short program that reproduces the problem 
attach it to a message addressed to me. If I can reproduce the problem, I 
can find a fix ! Do not send exe file but just source code and instructions.
Always use the latest version (beta if any) before reporting any bug.

You are also encouraged to use the support mailing list to ask for 
enhancements. You are welcome to post your own code.

The support mailing list has a heavy traffic: 20 to 40 messages each day. If
it is too much for you, you can select "digest" mode in which mailing list
processor will mail you only one big message per day. To select digest mode
goto http://elists.org/mailman/listinfo/twsocket.
 
You can also subscribe to another mailing list called twsocket-announce which 
will receive only very few messages when major bug fixes or updates are done. 
The subscription process is the same as for the other mailing list. 
See above procedure.


Release notes
-------------

There is no global release notes. Each component and sample has his own history.
You can find those histories in the comment in the beginning of each source file.
There are also a bunch of useful comments in the source code. You should at least
browse the source for the components you are interested in.


MidWare
-------
If you wants to build client/server applications using TCP/IP protocol, you 
can do it easily with ICS. But you can do it much more easily using another
freeware product from François Piette: MidWare. Available from the same web
site http://www.overbyte.be.


Known problems:
--------------

Old Delphi and C++Builder have limitation on path length. If you installed 
many components in many different subdirectories, you'll get strange errors. 
Just make the path shorter and use less different directories. You cannot have
a path greater than 255 characters (this problem is solved starting from 
Delphi 3.02 or later).

Using Delphi 3 Pro, there could a problem after inserting all the components
into your user package. Delphi 3 gives an access violation error in DCC.DLL.
This does not occur if you use Delphi C/S (That's what I do). Ben Ark
(BenArk@email.msn.com) has found the following procedure to overcome 
this [Delphi] bug:

---- copy of a message posted in twsocket@rtfm.be mailing list ----

Just thought I'd correct that previous message with some more detailed
steps...

1)	Remove the EmulVT and TnEmulVT units from your User Package.
2)	Create a new project/application.
3)	Put all of these new files in a directory separate from your components.
4)	MOVE, do not copy, your Emulvt.pas source file into this new directory.
5)	You need to add Emulvt.pas to the new project.
6)	Build the project.
7)	This should generate an Emultvt.dcu in the directory where the project
        is.
8)	Copy ONLY the DCU file into your component directory
9)	Add EmulVT.dcu to your User Package.
10)	Make sure the EmulVT.pas file IS NOT on your search path.
11)	Now you can safely add TnEmulVT.pas to your User Package and build
        it.

If you have any problems with these steps, let me know.

Thank you Ben !

Eric Daniels <sparky@netgsi.com> also found the same problem with Delphi 3
standard. Here what's he tell me in a message:

---- copy of a message posted in twsocket@rtfm.be mailing list ----

This error does happen under Delphi 3 Standard which I use...  I traced it
down and found out to trigger this error all one needs to do is go to:
package options / compiler  / debugging section  and look for local symbols
if this is not checked I will get this error.  After playing around with my
compiler options I unchecked local symbols and rebuilt the package and
Access Violation in dcc.dll read of address occurred...  If anyone has this
happen while using the ics components that is how I managed to fix it.  Also
I got error about unable to find *.dcr files if you edit your package source
and specify the full path to each dcr file you will find all goes well.

(Ok, I introduced new errors since I updated this file... For those
who care, I normally speak French.)
